## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Redis (via Docker)
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/A2AMCP.git
   cd A2AMCP
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Start Redis**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d redis
   ```

5. **Run the MCP server locally**
   ```bash
   python mcp_server_redis.py
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=a2amcp

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_client.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting  
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run all checks:
```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check linting
flake8

# Check types
mypy .
```

## SDK Development

### Adding a New SDK

1. Create a new directory under `sdk/` for your language
2. Follow the API patterns established by the Python SDK
3. Include:
   - Core client implementation
   - Type definitions/interfaces
   - Lifecycle management
   - Examples
   - Tests
   - README with quickstart
4. Update the main README.md
5. Add to sdk/TODO.md

### SDK Design Principles

- **Simple by default**: Easy things should be easy
- **Powerful when needed**: Complex things should be possible
- **Type safe**: Use language features for type safety
- **Consistent API**: Similar patterns across SDKs
- **Well documented**: Every public API needs docs
- **Tested**: Aim for >80% test coverage

## Documentation

### Writing Documentation

- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples for every feature
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Keep examples realistic and practical
- Update docs with any API changes

### Documentation Structure

- **README.md**: Quick start and overview
- **API_REFERENCE.md**: Complete API documentation
- **SDK READMEs**: Language-specific guides
- **Examples**: Working code examples

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure

```python
def test_agent_registration():
    """Test that agent can register with server"""
    # Arrange
    client = A2AMCPClient("localhost:5000")
    project = Project(client, "test-project")
    
    # Act
    agent = Agent(project, "001", "feature/test", "Test")
    result = await agent.register()
    
    # Assert
    assert result['status'] == 'registered'
    assert agent._registered is True
```

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers:
   - `sdk/python/setup.py`
   - `sdk/python/src/a2amcp/__init__.py`
   - Main README.md

2. Update CHANGELOG.md

3. Create release PR

4. After merge, tag release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

5. Build and publish packages
